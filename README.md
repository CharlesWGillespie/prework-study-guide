# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The webpage is created for bootcamp students who are going through the Prework. It contains HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I have learned that HTML is the foundation of the application, CSS is used to style the application (give it life), Javascript to add funcationality, and Git to tie everything together.
